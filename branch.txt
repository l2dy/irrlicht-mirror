about
-----

This branch is for work on a generic skeletal animator for
all bone based mesh formats


roadmap
-------

 - finish CSkinnedMesh
 - convert MS3D and X loaders to use the new format
 - Add compile config macros for excluding specific loaders

changes
-------

 - can now update the normals when skinning

 - initial import to irrlicht svn branch

 - Can convert the mesh at runtime to use tangent mesh buffers (bumpmapping)

 - b3d loader now fully working with skinnedmesh to load and animate any mesh

 - keys now use floats for frames, it maybe needed

 - added getFrameData() and buildAll_LocalAnimatedMatrices()  to CSkinnedMesh

 - added CalculateGlobalMatrixes() to CSkinnedMesh

 - added an enum and get/set functions to IBoneSceneNode for animation mode, started readme.txt

 - added files for x and ms3d importers using CSkinnedMesh. MS3D looks easy enough

 - added methods to get pointers for bones and buffers, and finalize() to CSkinnedMesh

 - fleshed out the loader and (I/C)BoneSceneNode, haven't tried compiling it yet

 - added BoneSceneNode, and B3DMeshLoader

 - Started project
