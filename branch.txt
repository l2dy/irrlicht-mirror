Changes
-------

 - made internal variables in ISkinnedMesh::SWeight private, and added CSkinnedMesh as a friend.

 - converted the ms3d loader, animation doesn't seem to be working yet.

 - added defines in IrrCompileConfig for excluding loaders

 - split and removed default mesh format loader

 - can now update the normals when skinning

 - initial import to irrlicht svn branch

 - Can convert the mesh at runtime to use tangent mesh buffers (bumpmapping)

 - b3d loader now fully working with skinnedmesh to load and animate any mesh

 - keys now use floats for frames, it maybe needed

 - added getFrameData() and buildAll_LocalAnimatedMatrices()  to CSkinnedMesh

 - added CalculateGlobalMatrixes() to CSkinnedMesh

 - added an enum and get/set functions to IBoneSceneNode for animation mode, started readme.txt

 - added files for x and ms3d importers using CSkinnedMesh. MS3D looks easy enough

 - added methods to get pointers for bones and buffers, and finalize() to CSkinnedMesh

 - fleshed out the loader and (I/C)BoneSceneNode, haven't tried compiling it yet

 - added BoneSceneNode, and B3DMeshLoader

 - Started project
